Keeping update of the last week's code.

Review last week's homework, I truned the clock into a character itself.

For this week, I'll add the one button game element into it.

The **concept** of this game is:
"Placing the 20 dots on the clock's face! Avoiding his eyes and mouth!"
<br />

Here is the sketch of the game:

1. This is the intro page of the game. The eyes of the clock are black and follow the circle on the screen.

   Click the button to start the game!

3. Oops ðŸ™Š ! Placing on his eyes or mouse, the game is over. 

   And the placed dot will turn red, and his eyes turn black.

5. A "Win!!!" button shows up with sound effects.

PS: I'll consider adding sound effects to the game. Every click with sound!

[Still in constructing ...]
